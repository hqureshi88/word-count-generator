Produced this code for a job application, where I was asked to do the following,

Write a program for generating statistics from a text file. Your program should accept a path to a file as input and produce the following statistics:

#Word count
#Line count
#Mean word length

You can write your solution in a programming language of your choice. We will be evaluating your solution primarily on it’s correctness, readability and extensibility.

Although i didnt get the job, I did get some positive feedback with constructive criticsm. See below, 

#My program does not accept a file path as input - user shouldn’t have to edit the source of the program to get it to read a different file.

#My program calculates the mean_word_length for each line of the file.

#A common mistake I managed to avoid is assuming that there will only be a single space between words. Words could be separated by multiple spaces and / or tabs and my program handles both of these cases.

#My program is memory efficient, many other candidates either read the entire file into memory, read the file multiple times or both. 

Mines was among the better solutions, however they have an extremely limited number of candidates to take on board due to the size of their team so I narrowly missed out.
